This folder contains several python script tools that can be used with the SCD:

    - clis.py: command line interface for serial communication to the SCD
        Run the cli by typing "python clis.py -h". You should see all the possible options.

        Example to read eeprom:

        "python clis.py /dev/ttyACM0 --geteepromhex"
        or
        "python clis.py /dev/ttyACM0 --geteepromhex file.hex"

        where /dev/ttyACM0 is the serial port where the SCD is connected.

        USAGE Virtual Serial
        Connect the SCD using the the USB cable to the host (PC), select the Virtual Serial
        application and then use this script.

        REQUIREMENTS
        You need to install Python 2.7 or later as well as the PySerial module.
        

    - scdtrace.py: parses the contents of an EEPROM dump (i.e. the .hex file that you get
        from the SCD) and shows the details of the EMV commands and responses. See the
        clis.py "--vet" option for a similar tool.
