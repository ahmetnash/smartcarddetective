TOOLS AND USAGE

    - clis.py: command line interface for serial communication to the SCD
        Run the cli by typing "python clis.py -h". You should see all the possible options.

        EXAMPLES

        To read the EEPROM (containing the log data):
        "python clis.py --geteepromhex file.hex /dev/ttyACM0"

        To visualize the EEPROM contents directly (on stdout):
        "python clis.py --vet file.hex /dev/ttyACM0"

        To start the terminal application:
        "python clis.py --terminal /dev/ttyACM0"

        To send user-defined commands to a smartcard:
        "python clis.py --userterminal terminal.txt /dev/ttyACM0"
        where the file terminal.txt must contain lines of command+data and end
        with the string "0000000000" as in the example terminal.txt provided.

        To program the device using dfu-programmer:
        "python clis.py --programhex ../../avrsrc/scd.hex /dev/ttyACM0"
        where you can pass an arbitrary file containing the .hex SCD software.
        Note: this should not contain the bootloader code, which can only
        be programmed using the AVR Dragon.

        To capture a card-reader transaction:
        "python clis.py --logt /dev/ttyACM0"

        where /dev/ttyACM0 is the serial port where the SCD is connected.


        USAGE Virtual Serial
        Connect the SCD using the the USB cable to the host (PC), select the Virtual Serial
        application and then use this script.

        REQUIREMENTS
        You need to install Python 2.7 or later as well as the PySerial module.
        

    - scdtrace.py: parses the contents of an EEPROM dump (i.e. the .hex file
      containing the log that you get from the SCD) and shows the details of
      the EMV commands and responses. See the clis.py "--vet" option as well.

    Note 1: the limited EEPROM size restricts the log to one or two full
    transactions only. However, since the last version of the software (2.4.2)
    you can create a script that automatically records logs, transfers them to
    a PC and then erases the EEPROM in order to start again recording. That is,
    you can write a script with something similar to this:

    python clis.py --eraseeeprom /dev/ttyACM0
    python clis.py --logt /dev/ttyACM0
    python clis.py --geteepromhex trace1.hex /dev/ttyACM0
    python clis.py --eraseeeprom /dev/ttyACM0
    python clis.py --logt /dev/ttyACM0
    python clis.py --geteepromhex trace2.hex /dev/ttyACM0
    ....

    Then you can examine the trace files (trace1.hex, ...) by using the
    scdtrace.py tool:

    python scdtrace.py trace1.hex
    ...

    Note 2: some readers perform two consecutive transactions. First they
    retrieve only the ATR from the card and then perform a reset before
    commencing the transaction. In these cases it is necessary to execute
    the "logt" command twice:
    python clis.py --logt /dev/ttyACM0 (first)
    ... (wait for ATR, you should see an "All done" message
    python clis.py --logt /dev/ttyACM0 (second)

    then you can continue the processing (storing trace, etc.).
