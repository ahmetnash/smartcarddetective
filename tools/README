This folder contains tools useful in combination with the SCD.

Currently there are the following tools:
    - pytools/: several python scripts useful in using the SCD and
      visualising the EEPROM data.
      See pytools/README for more details.
    - lufa_cdc_driver_windows.inf: driver needed for the Virtual Serial to work in Windows.
      If you are using Windows you should install this driver to communicate with the
      SCD after selecting the Virtual Serial application.
