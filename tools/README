This folder contains different tools useful in combination with the SCD.

Currently there are the following tools:
    - pyscripts/: several python scripts useful in parsing SCD EEPROM data and performing other operations.
               See pyscripts/README for more details.

    - pyserialcli/: a python command line interface to communicate with the SCD over serial or virtual serial (USB) port.
               See pyserialcli/README for more details.

    - install_avr_tools.sh: a script to install all the necessary tools for programming/debugging the SCD in linux.
