This folder contains tools useful in combination with the SCD.

Currently there are the following tools:
    - pytools/: several python scripts useful in using the SCD and
      visualising the EEPROM data.
      See pytools/README for more details.

    - install_avr_tools.sh: a script to install all the necessary
      tools for programming/debugging the SCD in linux. Make sure to
      look at the requirements mentioned in the header of this script.
