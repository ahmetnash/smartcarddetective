This folder contains the command line interface for serial communication to the SCD.

Run the cli by typing "python clis.py -h". You should see all the possible options.

Connect the SCD using the serial port or the USB Virtual Serial port and then run any desired command.

Example to read eeprom:

"python clis.py /dev/ttyACM0 --geteepromhex"
or 
"python clis.py /dev/ttyACM0 --geteepromhex file.hex"

where /dev/ttyACM0 is the serial port where the SCD is connected.


REQUIREMENTS
You need to install Python 2.7 or later as well as the PySerial module.
