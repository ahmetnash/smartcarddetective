Known issues for The Smart Card Detective.

Current software version: 2.4.2

Issue 1: There is no implementation for the T=1 communication protocol.
I just don't have time to do that yet. Any volunteers welcome.

Issue 2: Some readers (e.g. Barclays CAP reader) do not properly deactivate
the smartcard contacts. The current implementation of the SCD waits forever
for a terminal reset when using the ForwardData app.
Current solution: disconnect and re-connect the reader to complete the
data recording.
