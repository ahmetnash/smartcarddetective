Current version: 2.4.0

******************************************
CHANGES from 2.3.4:
******************************************
- Introduced a millisecond counter that can be used to trace events.
- Rewritten the logging mechanism completely. Now every byte sent or received by
  either the card or the terminal can be logged independently, including the
  bytes in the ATR. Also the counter is used to put timestamps into the log.
  The limitation of the current hardware is the 8KB available of EEPROM which
  effectively limits the logging capability to just a few full traces.
  See the file scd_logger.h for the memory allocation. Change this with care,
  since the malloc library uses the same memory as the log buffer (8KB of SRAM).
- Sleep mode disabled in most of the applications, in order to enable an
  accurate time-stamp of events even after many successive applications. 
- Fixed many bugs I found along the way (hopefully I didn't introduce many new
  ones).
- Affected files: all.
- New files: scd_logger.h, scd_logger.c, counter.h
