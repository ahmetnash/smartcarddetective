The files provided along with this README are part of the Smart Card Detective (SCD).
The SCD is meant to provide an open framework for EMV research, enabling users to
analyze transactions. The software is given under the GPL v3 license (see file
gpl-3.0.txt). The rights of this code or its license can be modified in future
versions.

REQUIREMENTS
In order to compile this project you need the avr-libc and avr-gcc tools.
Please use avr-libc version 1.7.0 or higher as the previous versions have problems
with the malloc functions.
See http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/ for more information.

BUILD
Compile the project using the command "make all"

DEBUG/PROGRAM
I recommend using an AVR Dragon for programming and debugging of your chip. Use
avrdude to program your chip. If you don't have a hardware platform look at
my website for the hardware files. Get in touch with me if you want to order
a SCD device.

Use "make program" to program the SCD using avrdude.

Use "make avarice" to debug the application using the SCD and AVR Dragon.

Use "make debug" to connect avr-gdb to avarice (once avarice is running).

DOCUMENTATION
You can find the documentation in HTML format for the source code in the doc/ folder.
Point your browser to the doc/html/index.html file.
